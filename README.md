- Hi, Iâ€™m Jason Aguda
- Iâ€™m interested in gaming, programming, and cybersecurity
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to code again! (its been a while)
- I'm originally from Oahu
- I'm a 4th year Junior in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I used to be in Electrical Engineering, and missed coding things.
- A fun fact about me is:  I'm practicing muay thai ðŸ‘ŠðŸ¦µ
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn how to write good code
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: The Barbarian (Movie)
